Society for Science & the Public and Regeneron named the 40 finalists in the Regeneron Science Talent Search, the nation's oldest and most prestigious science and math competition for high school seniors, on January 23. Science Talent Search alumni have made extraordinary contributions to science and hold more than 100 of the world’s most coveted science and math honors, including the Nobel Prize and the National Medal of Science. Students are selected based upon their scientific research and also on their overall potential as future leaders of the scientific community. Last year, Regeneron became only the third sponsor of the Science Talent Search, with a 10-year, $100 million commitment. Regeneron is a company founded with the goal of transforming lives through science and its most important and social commitment has been to support the development of highly engaged, well-trained and innovative young thinkers. On January 9, Society for Science & the Public and Regeneron announced the 300 students named as Scholars. Each scholar and their school were awarded $2,000. From that select pool, 40 finalists are then invited to Washington, D.C. in March to undergo final judging, display their work to the public, meet with notable scientists, and compete for $1.8 million in awards. Each finalist will receive a minimum $25,000 award, with a top award of $250,000.

Since 1942, first in partnership with Westinghouse, then with Intel 1998-2016 and now with Regeneron, the Society has provided a national stage for the country's best and brightest young scientists to present original research to nationally recognized professional scientists. Intel ISEF The Intel International Science and Engineering Fair (Intel ISEF), a program of Society for Science & the Public (SSP), is the world’s largest international pre-college science competition. Each year approximately 1,800 high school students from more than 75 countries, regions, and territories get the opportunity to showcase their independent research and compete for on average $4 million in prizes.
